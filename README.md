For printPrimeNumbers i had to make sure the output did not have the last comma, that was the challenging part

For getSeriesResult it was interesting to find the pattern and then using factorial function to do the math. 
One thing to keep in mind is conversion of integer to float.

For print triangle it was challenging to find the pattern of spaces and stars. When to put the spaces and when to put the stars.

For computeFrequency wanted to use plain arrays instead of a dictionary, just to see the code and found that 
it was more wasteful in eating up resources than a dictionary
